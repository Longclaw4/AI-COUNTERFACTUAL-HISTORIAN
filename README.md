# AI Counterfactual Historian

This project is a **Streamlit** web application that demonstrates a counterfactual historian AI model. It allows users to explore alternate histories based on various parameters. The application utilizes a machine learning model (or potentially rule-based logic) to generate counterfactual scenarios.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: Users can input historical events and specify alternate conditions to generate counterfactual scenarios.
- **Visualization**: The app displays the generated counterfactual outcomes with relevant insights and visualizations.
- **Real-time updates**: The Streamlit interface automatically updates as the user modifies input parameters.
